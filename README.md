# Temperature-DEBIPM
R code for generating, running and plotting the size- and temperature dependent DEBIPM in Thunell et al. 20.

## Info repository content

Rscript_DEBIPM_fitparams - Code for optimization

Rscript_DEBIPM_Model - DEB model describing size and temperature dependent energy acquisition and allocation to somatic growth and reproduction, functions for demographic functions in the IPM and the code for the derivatives (for perturbation analysis) for mass and temperature specific demographic functions with respect to $\kappa_0$.

Rscript_DEBIPM_RunModels - To run the DEBIPM to produce data for the main (1) and the two (2,3) contrasting survival rate models.

Rscript_DEBIPM_Plot - Code for graphically exploring the model, calculating sensitivities and creating the figures (Fig. 1-5) in the main text.
